# Numerical Algorithms lessons laboratory

This GIT repository contains the practical works for the Numerical Algorithms lessons during our study in Computing Engineering, majoring in Multimedia Software Development. The course had a heavy focus on JavaScript.

In each laboratory, you will find an HTML file to execute. You can use the [HTML preview tool](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).

## The laboratories

### Laboratory 1

We created a custom float type on 37 bits. Using Javascript, you can witness live how floating-point numbers work. 

### Laboratory 2

We created a function which solves equations.

### Laboratory 3

We made a script which solves linear systems with Gauss's method.

### Laboratory 4

We made a script which implements and derives the cosine.

### Laboratory 5

We made a script which implements Simpson's method.

### Laboratory 6

Made a script which simulates an object's velocity over time with a parachute.
